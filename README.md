# Determinant-Calculator
Inspired to find a fast way to find the determinant of a matrix, this program takes as an input an N x N matrix and calculates its determinant efficiently using recursion and by manipulating pointers.

Written in C, this program was developed by me to help me hone my skills in manipulating pointers, and working with recursion. To use this
program, you can simply download the file and run it. Following that, you will be prompted to enter to matrix you want to find the determinant
for. Then, the program will calculate the determinant and output it.
